    <h2>Research Focus</h2>
    <p>My research centers on making distributed systems more intelligent, reliable, and adaptive by applying machine learning techniques. I'm particularly interested in how ML can optimize distributed infrastructure at scale.</p>
    
    <div class="research-area">
      <h3>Adaptive Distributed Databases</h3>
      <p>I develop novel techniques for making distributed databases dynamically adapt to changing workload patterns and network conditions. This research has direct applications in cloud computing, edge computing, and large-scale data processing systems.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Designed adaptive sharding mechanisms that dynamically adjust data partitioning strategies based on access patterns</li>
        <li>Developed reinforcement learning approaches that optimize database configurations on-the-fly</li>
        <li>Created fault-tolerant distributed query processing algorithms that maintain performance under partial system failures</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="research-area">
      <h3>Machine Learning for Systems Optimization</h3>
      <p>I apply machine learning techniques to optimize system performance, reliability, and resource utilization in complex distributed environments.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Designed ML models that predict system bottlenecks and optimize resource allocation</li>
        <li>Created algorithms that use time-series forecasting to anticipate workload changes and adapt system configurations proactively</li>
        <li>Implemented deep learning approaches for anomaly detection in distributed systems</li>
      </ul>

    <div class="research-area">
      <h3>Blockchain and Byzantine Fault Tolerance</h3>
      <p>My research in blockchain focuses on improving consensus protocols and making blockchain systems more efficient and secure, particularly in the presence of Byzantine failures.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Developed AdaChain, a learned adaptive blockchain system that dynamically adjusts consensus parameters</li>
        <li>Designed efficient Byzantine fault-tolerant protocols that scale to thousands of nodes</li>
        <li>Created sharded blockchain architectures that maintain security guarantees while improving throughput</li>
      </ul>
