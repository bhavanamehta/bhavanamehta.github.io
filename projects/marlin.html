    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p style="line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
      Marlin is an adaptive sharded database tolerant to Byzantine faults. The system is designed with hypergraph-guided centralized architecture using KaHyPar-based cut minimization and key-affinity decentralized resharding atop BFT SMR and BFT-2PC protocols.

    <p style="line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
      The system achieves approximately 16,000 transactions per second (TPS) under adversarial skew conditions, cuts cross-shard coordination by approximately 33%, and scales to 32 clusters comprising 160 nodes with stable tail latency. Marlin employs rate-limited migration with safety throttles, comprehensive fault-injection and regression tests, and detailed profiling harnesses to ensure robust performance.
    </p>
    <p style="line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
      This research advances distributed database systems by providing a scalable solution for maintaining consistency and availability in Byzantine environments. The adaptive resharding mechanisms enable the system to respond dynamically to changing workload patterns while preserving strong fault tolerance guarantees.
