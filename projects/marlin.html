  <p class="project-meta">Distributed Systems â€¢ Byzantine Fault Tolerance</p>
  
  <div class="project-content">
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Marlin is an adaptive sharded database system designed to be tolerant to Byzantine faults while providing efficient hypergraph-guided resharding capabilities.</p>
    
    <h2>Key Features</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Byzantine fault tolerance in distributed database systems</li>
      <li>Hypergraph-guided resharding for optimal data distribution</li>
      <li>Adaptive sharding strategies based on workload patterns</li>
      <li>High availability and consistency guarantees</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Technical Details</h2>
    <p>This research project explores novel approaches to database sharding that can adapt to changing workloads while maintaining Byzantine fault tolerance. The system uses hypergraph algorithms to determine optimal shard boundaries and migration strategies.</p>
    
    <h2>Research Impact</h2>
    <p>This work contributes to the field of distributed systems by providing new insights into adaptive database architectures that can maintain consistency and availability in the presence of Byzantine failures.</p>
