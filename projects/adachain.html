  <div class="project-content">
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>AdaChain is a contextual-bandit runtime system that dynamically switches transaction paradigms per workload episode, enabling adaptive blockchain systems that can optimize for different types of workloads.</p>
    
    <h2>Key Features</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Contextual bandit algorithms for runtime adaptation</li>
      <li>Dynamic transaction paradigm switching</li>
      <li>Workload-aware optimization</li>
      <li>Machine learning-driven decision making</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Technical Details</h2>
    <p>This system uses contextual bandit algorithms to learn optimal transaction processing strategies based on current workload characteristics. The runtime can switch between different transaction paradigms (e.g., optimistic vs. pessimistic concurrency control) to maximize performance.</p>
    
    <h2>Research Impact</h2>
    <p>AdaChain demonstrates how machine learning techniques can be applied to blockchain systems to create more adaptive and efficient distributed ledgers that can optimize their behavior based on observed workload patterns.</p>
