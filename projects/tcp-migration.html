    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>A DPDK-based prototype system for ultra-fast TCP flow migration on commodity servers, enabling seamless transfer of network connections between servers without service interruption.</p>
    
    <h2>Key Features</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>DPDK-based kernel bypass networking</li>
      <li>Zero-downtime TCP connection migration</li>
      <li>High-performance packet processing</li>
      <li>Commodity hardware optimization</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Technical Details</h2>
    <p>This system leverages Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK) to bypass the kernel networking stack and achieve microsecond-level TCP connection migration. The prototype demonstrates how modern networking hardware can be used to create highly available distributed systems.</p>
    
    <h2>Performance Results</h2>
    <p>The system achieves sub-millisecond migration times for TCP connections, enabling new possibilities for load balancing and fault tolerance in high-performance distributed systems.</p>
    
    <h2>Research Impact</h2>
    <p>This work contributes to the field of high-performance networking by demonstrating practical techniques for TCP connection migration that can be deployed on commodity hardware.</p>
