    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p style="line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
      This project presents a DPDK-based prototype system for ultra-fast TCP flow migration on commodity servers. The system enables seamless reassignment of active TCP flows between servers, achieving migration times of approximately 4 microseconds on commodity hardware.
    </p>
    <p style="line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
      By leveraging the Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK) to bypass the kernel networking stack, the system achieves unprecedented performance in connection migration. Comprehensive analysis of tail latency and failure-recovery impact demonstrates the viability of this approach for production deployments.
    </p>
    <p style="line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
      This research contributes to the field of high-performance networking by demonstrating practical techniques for microsecond-level TCP connection migration on commodity hardware, enabling new possibilities for load balancing, fault tolerance, and dynamic resource management in distributed systems.
